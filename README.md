# Employee-Attrition-with-ML-Algorithms
# Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from the
kaggle website and
the data was collected from the Manager, Hr employees and
the Employees themselves in the form of feedback. Here, the
data makes use of 34 columns and they all contain proper
information regarding the company and the employees and their personal status.
The dataset was obtained from
kaggle which uses the real time data from IBM.

# Summary
We did use various Machine Learning
such as the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, SGD Classifier and the Neural Networks.
The ultimate aim is to prepare the data and train a model to
predict the output using a classifier algorithm. But then, the
IBM wants to that what are the major features that makes an
employee to quit his job. Hence, only three classifier algorithms
will used irrespective of whatever algorithm is used to increase
the accuracy of the model. Thereby, finding the major features
that causes the employee attrition and help the company to reduce
the employee attrition in significant figures.

# Conclusion
For implementing classifiers, we boiled down to few of the
features that are common in the three algorithms we used are
Age, JobRole, HourlyRate, MonthlyRate, DailyRate, etc. Now
scaling all these features to bring the numerical data under
the single magnitude between 0 to 1, we did find that when
the employee gets comfortable with the Job and the payment,
they do not work as much as the Manager expects from them
and when the yearly review is calculated these employees
who has very good pay-scale have the chances of getting a
default rating and end up themselves in the companyâ€™s Lay-Off
program-me. This makes the employees to go for a volunteer
resignation just for the sake of employee benefits.
Hence, for companies like IBM, they need work on their
pay-scale for employees and keep working on their job roles
and position so that, the employees do not feel comfortable
with their current position and instead they get the work done
from the employees. This will return lot of work done by
the employees and they will have to keep them updated and
the Managers can churn the employees with only occasionally
increments instead of the salary Hike. This will reduce the
Employees to get good ratings and help them to remain at the
company.
